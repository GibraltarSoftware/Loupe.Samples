This project contains an example of fetching Loupe sessions from a console application.

It shows the login process and the call parameters for calling the session query.

If using internally within a Loupe Enterprise installation, with accounts managed
by Active Directory, you will not need the Login method, but the user you run this under
must be a user within the Active Directory configured within Loupe and a Loupe user.
